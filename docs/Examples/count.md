### count
This counts how many times the pattern appears in the string.    
The pattern has to be a str if it is not it will be automatically converted    
**You can use regex**

`BetterString.count_pattern(pattern)`

Example:
```python
import BetterString

test_string = BetterString.BetterString("This Is A Test String")

print(test_string.count("e"))
```
